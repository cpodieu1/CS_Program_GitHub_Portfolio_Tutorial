## Essential Questions

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs begins with listening and asking clarifying questions: Who is the user, what problem are they trying to solve, and under what conditions? Writing **user stories** (“As a <role>, I want <goal> so that <benefit>”) forces me to focus on the user’s context and outcome rather than jumping straight to technical details. Each story comes with acceptance criteria that describe exactly when it’s “done,” which guides design, testing, and feedback loops. This structure ensures I build only what delivers real value.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I tackle development in **small, iterative increments**:
1. **Backlog refinement** to break big features into manageable stories.  
2. **Sprint planning** to commit to a clear set of stories.  
3. **Daily stand-ups** for quick status checks and immediate obstacle removal.  
4. **Continuous integration & automated tests** to catch regressions early.  
5. **Sprint review & demo** to collect feedback from stakeholders, then  
6. **Retrospectives** to inspect what went well and adapt.  
Over time, I’d like to deepen my use of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, embrace **pair programming**, and automate more of my deployment pipeline (CI/CD).

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good teammate means:
- **Communicating openly** sharing progress, risks, and questions early.  
- **Respecting others’ time** keeping stand-ups brief, reviewing pull requests promptly, and pairing when help is needed.  
- **Collaborating generously** offering to help unblock colleagues, contributing to collective code ownership, and creating clear documentation.  
- **Owning quality** writing clean, well-tested code and speaking up when you see architectural or process improvements.  
A strong team member builds trust by being reliable, transparent, and always willing to learn from—and teach—others.
